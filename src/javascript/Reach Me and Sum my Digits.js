/* 
We have the first value of a certain sequence, we will name it init_val. We define pattern list, pattern_l, an array that has the differences between contiguous terms of the sequence.  E.g: pattern_l = [k1, k2, k3, k4]

The terms of the sequence will be such values that:

term1 = init_val
term2 - term1 = k1
term3 - term2 = k2
term4 - term3 = k3
term5 - term4 = k4
term6 - term5 = k1
term7 - term6 = k2
term8 - term7 = k3
term9 - term8 = k4
....  - ..... = ...
....  - ..... = ...

So the values of the differences between contiguous terms are cyclical and are repeated as the differences values of the pattern list stablishes.

Let's see an example with numbers:

init_val = 10
pattern_l = [2, 1, 3]
term1 = 10
term2 = 12
term3 = 13
term4 = 16
term5 = 18
term6 = 19
term7 = 22  # and so on...

We can easily obtain the next terms of the sequence following the values in the pattern list. We see that the sixth term of the sequence, 19, has the sum of its digits 10.

Make a function sum_dig_nth_term(), that receives three arguments in this order

sum_dig_nth_term(init_val, pattern_l, nth_term(ordinal number of the term in the sequence)) 

This function will output the sum of the digits of the n-th term of the sequence.

Let's see some cases for this function:

sum_dig_nth_term(10, [2, 1, 3], 6) -----> 10 
# because the sixth term is 19 sum of Dig = 1 + 9 = 10. 
# The sequence up to the sixth-Term is: 10, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19

sum_dig_nth_term(10, [1, 2, 3], 15) ----> 10 
# 37 is the 15-th term, and 3 + 7 = 10

Enjoy it and happy coding!!

function sumDigNthTerm(initval, patternl, nthterm) {
  let result = initval;

  for (let i = 0; i < nthterm - 1; i++) {
    result += patternl[i % patternl.length];
  }
  return [...String(result)].reduce((acc, curr) => acc + Number(curr), 0);
}
