/* 
Spin-off of this kata, here you will have to figure out
an efficient strategy to solve the problem of finding
the sole duplicate number among an unsorted array/list of numbers
starting from 1 up to n.

Hints:
a solution in linear time can be found;
using the most intuitive ones to search for duplicates
that can run in O(nÂ²) time won't work
