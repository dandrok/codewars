//In JavaScript, Strings are compared lexicographically (i.e. based on their unicode values),
//and the string 'L' is lexicographically greater than the empty object '{}' and the string 'o' is
//lexicographically smaller than the empty object '{}',
//so the function will return true for exmple 'L' and false for example'o'

//f=s=>s<{}
